### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with 3 years professional work experience and a first-class degree in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence.

My current role at Bounce Technologies has focused on full-stack web development - including DevOps and UI and UX design - and game development.

Iâ€™ve worked with a wide variety of languages, technologies and architectures. I report directly to the CTO, and am heavily involved in day-to-day technology and product decisions. I have personally led customer-facing projects from scratch, as well as working in a small team to deliver production-ready software.

### ðŸ’­ Currently I am learning

TypeScript with React and Next.js, as well as Golang.
